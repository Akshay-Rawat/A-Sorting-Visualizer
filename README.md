Sorting Visualizer is a web-based project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that helps users understand how different sorting algorithms work through real-time visual animations. The application generates a random array and allows users to visualize sorting step-by-step using separate controls for each algorithm.

This project includes Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort, each implemented with asynchronous animations to clearly show comparisons and swaps. A clean and minimal UI ensures smooth interaction and easy understanding of algorithm behavior.

The project is ideal for students, beginners, and interview preparation, providing an intuitive way to learn time complexity and algorithm efficiency.
